 IDS for DDoS attacks in LAN

Heimadall IDS is using paramiko library (https://github.com/paramiko/paramiko). Licence for this library can be found in folder licences.
Import of paramiko can be done from cli by command:'pip install paramiko'. In case of trouble with pip, actualize him by command 'sudo apt install python3-pip' and repeat previous command.paramiko

Heimdall IDS is created for my Bachelor Degree Work and his purpose is to detect and mitigate Flooding Attacks.
